This repository contains the numerical mode of ray traccing equations applied to inertial gravity waves in geostrophic flows. The code was used to conduct simulations in the JPO paper [Geostrophic Eddies Spread Near-Inertial Wave Energy to High Frequencies](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/53/5/JPO-D-22-0153.1.xml)
